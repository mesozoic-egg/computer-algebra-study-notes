## Number representation

An $l$ digit base $b$ number is annotated as:

$$N = \pm(d_{l-1} ...d_1d_0)_b$$

For example, let's look at decimal number 5305. It has 4 digits, so l is 4. The
base is 10, so b is 10, and the number is represented as:

$$ 5305_{dec} = +(5_{3}3_{2}0_{1}5_{0})_{10} $$

Let's look at a base 16 number 95A (the value is 2394 in decimal). It has
3 digits, so l is 3; base is 16, so b is 16, and the number is represented as:

$$ 95A_{hex} = +(9_{2}5_{1}A_{0})_{16} $$

## Calculating the value

The value of N is calculated as:

$$ \pm \sum_{i=0}^{l-1} d_i b^i $$

This means, iterate from $i=0$ to $l-1$, and sum up the value of $d_i b^i$.

Note that when we calculate the value, it essentially means convert the value to decimal. 
Let's look at the decimal example to see the output matches the value itself 5305

$$ 5305_{dec} = +(5_{3}3_{2}0_{1}5_{0})_{10} $$

$$  = \sum_{i=0}^{3} d_i 10^i  $$

$$ = 5 * 10^3 + 3 * 10^2 + 0 * 10^1 + 5 * 10^0 = 5000 + 300 + 0 + 5 = 5305 $$

Let's look at the base 16 (hexadeicmal example). The value is 95A:

$$ 95A_{hex} = +(9_{2}5_{1}A_{0})_{16} $$


$$ = \sum_{i=0}^2 d_i 16^i $$

$$ = 9 * 16^2 + 5 * 16^1 + 10 * 16^0 $$
$$ = 9 * 256 + 5 * 16 + 10 * 1 $$
$$ = 2304 + 80 + 10 $$
$$ = 2394 $$
